<p>Below we have a <code>Task</code> model and we&rsquo;re perfoming a <code>find</code> on that model.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class TaskController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @tasks = Task.find_all_by_complete_(:false, :order =&gt; "created_at DESC")
  end
end
</pre>
<p>If the <code>find</code> is being performed several times throughout the application then there will be duplication. One way to remove this duplication is to move the find into the model, which would allow us to call</p>
<pre class="ruby">@tasks = Task.find_incomplete</pre> 
<p>in the controller. To do this we&rsquo;ll need to create a new method in the model. The method has to be a class method so must start with <code>self</code>.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :project

  def self.find_incomplete
    find_all_by_complete_(:false, :order =&gt; "created_at DESC")
  end
end
</pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to specify <code>Task</code> in the <code>find</code> line as the find is already scoped inside the <code>Task</code> class. Now you can call <code>Task.find_incomplete</code> whenever you need to perform that find. This will even work in associations so that you can find <code>Project</code>&rsquo;s incomplete tasks like this:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class ProjectsController &lt; ApplicationController
    def show
        @project = Project.find(params[:id])
        @tasks = @project.tasks.find_incomplete
    end
end
</pre>
